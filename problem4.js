// Analyze the following function (without running it in an IDE) to determine what problem it is trying to solve. What is the time complexity of this algorithm?

// I believe this function removes duplicates from a list.

// I want to say that the function would be O(n^2) because the runtime depends on the length of the list being purged of duplicates, but its running on n characters in the list. So n*n would be O(n^n). Best case run time would be O(1) if there is only one item.
